Or, in a simple command, `pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter notebook`  
Note: You may want to add `--user`, at least if you're on windows... If you do so and have installed Pyton for all users or on a custom folder, you will need to add `appdata/roaming/user/python/python38/`
TODO: Check how it works on linux, and more details for windows
